# Python Fundamentals for Developers

This repository serves as a personal learning log for my journey through the "Associate Python Developer" career track on Datacamp. My goal is to actively reinforce my understanding of fundamental Python concepts by taking my own notes and creating practical code examples.

### Content & Topics Covered

The contents of this repository cover the core topics from the first two courses in the Datacamp track:

* **Introduction to Python for Developers**
* **Intermediate Python for Developers**

I will be adding my personal notes and solutions to exercises in this space.

### Project Structure

The project is structured to separate learning notes from practical applications:

* `core_concepts.ipynb`: Contains my personal notes and code examples for each topic, serving as a comprehensive study guide.
* `projects/`: This directory will house mini-projects and small applications I develop to apply the concepts I've learned.
